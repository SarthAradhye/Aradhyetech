                    Most AI chatbots today are built with data that doesn’t reflect our languages, culture, or diverse
                    viewpoints. They often present a one-sided narrative, missing the depth of real discussions.
                    <br><br>
                    But what if you could see all sides of a conversation and form your own opinions?

                <h3>Cameras Watch, But Do They Truly See?</h3>
                <p>
                    Everywhere we go, security cameras are watching. But are they really keeping us safe? Traditional
                    CCTV systems only record footage, leaving security teams to sift through hours of video—often after
                    an incident has already happened.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>💡 What if there was a smarter way?</li>
                    <li>💡 What if cameras could detect threats in real-time and alert the right people instantly?</li>
                    <li>💡 What if security wasn’t just about watching but truly understanding?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>🚀 Introducing Vishwalaksha AI – India’s First AI-Powered Smart Surveillance!</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>✅ Detects Suspicious Activities Instantly</b> – Identifies threats like unauthorized access,
                        unattended objects, and unusual movements in real time.</li>

                        detected.</li>

                        for investigation.</li>
                    <li><b>✅ Reduces False Alarms</b> – AI differentiates between normal behavior and potential threats,

                <h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because prevention is better than reaction. In today’s world, security threats evolve rapidly, and
                    <b>old-school CCTV systems can’t keep up.</b>
